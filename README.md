## About

This repository serves as my personal portfolio for various React applications. By working on these projects, I aim to gain hands-on experience with components, state management, hooks, and routing, among other topics.

## Current Projects

Here are the projects I've completed so far:

1. **Background Color Changer**  
   Description: A simple application that allows users to change the background color of the page using a color picker.

2. **Counter Application**  
   Description: An interactive counter application where users can increase, decrease, and reset a counter. This project helped me understand how to manage state effectively in React.

3. **Password Generator**  
   Description: A password generator that creates a random password based on the specified number of characters. Users can adjust the range for the length of the password, making it flexible and user-friendly.

- JavaScript
